Data Professional Survery Dashboard - K Vikram Sundar

Project Description: The project is based on analysis of Survey Data for employees/aspirants entering into the Data field which is obtained by Web Scraping where the goal is to clean,transform and analyse the data and prepare a dashboard which contains relevant insights using Power BI.

Approach: We import the given dataset into Power BI and begin with cleaning and transformation of the survey Data with Power Query. Later we use this data to create various summarizations using Tables and Matrix along with the required DAX measures to build a dashboard with various charts/graphs to visualize the data.

Tools/Technologies Used: In this project , we use Power BI as the primary tool to gather relevant insights from the given data. We use data cleaning and data using Power Query and use Power BI to develop interactive and customizable visualizations in the form of charts/graphs to create a sophisticated dashboard.

Insights: The dashboard contains key metrics such as the Average Age of Survey Takers, Total Number of Survey Takers,Average Ratings which showcases Happiness with Work-Life Balance and Happiness with Salary.It also contains various visualizations to represent factors such as Survey Takers by Country, Average Salary by Job Title, Favorite Programming Lanhguage, Difficulty to break into the Data Field.

Result: The end-result is a high-end interactive dashboard developed using Power BI to showcase the insights with a sophisticated design which helps the stakeholders to understand the insights easier and also interact with the dashboard to additionally filter the data as per requirement.

Overall Learning and Progress: This project really helped me to understand the working of Power BI on an advanced level by cleaning and transforming the data using Power Query which is a powerful tool integrated into Power BI for data cleaning and transformation. Using various visualizations to summarize the data in the form of a dashboard, it helped enhance my understanding of the core featues of Power BI and how to use them effectively.
